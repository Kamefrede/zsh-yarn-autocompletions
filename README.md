# zsh-yarn-autocompletions

## Installation

You need to compile the Rust code by yourself,
so Rust development is needed.

Once you compiled the source code to binary,
please run:

```shell
$ mkdir $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/yarn-autocompletions
```

Then put the `yarn-autocompletions.plugin.zsh` file
and the binary files to the directory you created before.
